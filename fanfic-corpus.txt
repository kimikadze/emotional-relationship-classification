Right now the adults are gathered upstairs , and four of the six Stark kids ( Arya may be a college student now , but she refuses to think of herself as anything but a kid ) are gathered in their basement , their usual hang out . Rickon is simultaneously playing Minecraft and texting Shireen Baratheon - according to Bran , the pair have been dating for two months - and EXP-Arya-EXP is slightly pissed off that TARG-Rickon-TARG has a better love life than she does . Nevertheless , tonight is Bran's night , not hers , so she makes a mental note to sulk about it on a later date . ( That is , if she isn't having seriously great sex with Gendry on a later date . ) She's sitting on the beanbag in the corner , hogging the popcorn , much to Jon and Robb's aggravation .

" Jon mumbles something incoherent that is probably something along the lines of , " Ummm . " Sansa looks down at her feet and mutters something about " something I need to tell you guys , " and Bran echoes her . Bemused , EXP-Arya-EXP looks at TARG-Rickon-TARG in turn . " What is it them ?

Valinor is a beautiful place , to be sure , but it is no Shire , no Hobbiton , no Bag End , and his heart cries out for some semblance of home . Oh , there is EXP-Bilbo-EXP dear TARG-Frodo-TARG of course , but the lad is quite busy scrubbing away the grief and old-fear , the nightmares that continue to linger , and Bilbo cannot help but think that he has been torn unequivocally in two .

Strange , how the ache in  EXP-Bilbo-EXP  chest has begun to ease at the sight of his old friends , and as the salt-water spray of the sea soaks the very tips of Bilbo's hairy toes he is pervaded by a sense of absolute belonging .

Oh , there is his dear Frodo , of course , but  EXP-Frodo-EXP  is quite busy scrubbing away the grief and old-fear , the nightmares that continue to linger , and Bilbo cannot help but think that he has been torn unequivocally in two . One half yearns for peace , yes . Peace and home and a little garden of herbs and flowers to tend , and perhaps a well-stocked larder . It sounds so very dull . And the other ? Oh , what he would not give for the weight of Sting in his hand once more . So deeply does he reflect that he does not hear the approach

Why couldn ’ t he just tell her and so she could stop worrying about it . Poe seemed to realise how uncomfortable  EXP-Rey-EXP  was and said : “ Well , if I was her I would like to know if I can call Lord Doucheface brother or cousin , to be honest . ” His words made Leia wince but silently Rey thanked Poe for agreeing with her . She hadn ’ t had such close friends before and seeing them stick up for her filled her with happiness and gratitude . It was enough to make her forget how awkward she sometimes felt around them when they were being cute with each other . “ What does it matter if he ’

It was no use trying to say a word to him when he was with the chief clerk . The man felt that his position was bad enough . He had been obliged to offer an abject apology to Mr Alleyne for his impertinence but he knew what a hornet ’ s nest the office would be for him . He could remember the way in which Mr Alleyne had hounded little Peake out of the office in order to make room for his own nephew .  EXP-Farrington-EXP  felt savage and thirsty and revengeful , annoyed with himself and with everyone else . Mr Alleyne would never give him an hour ’ s rest ; his life would be a hell to him . He had made a proper fool of himself this time . Could he not keep his tongue in his cheek ? But they had never pulled together from the first , he and Mr Alleyne , ever since the day Mr Alleyne had overheard him mimicking his North of Ireland accent to amuse Higgins and Miss Parker : that had been the beginning of

Then , as if he had been unaware of the man ’ s presence till that moment , he shot up his head again , saying : “ Eh ? Are you going to stand there all day ? Upon my word , Farrington , you take things easy ! ” “ I was waiting to see . . . . ” “ Very good , you needn ’ t wait to see . Go downstairs and do your work . ”  EXP-Farrington-EXP  walked heavily towards the door and , as he went out of the room , he heard Mr Alleyne cry after him that if the contract was not copied by evening Mr Crosbie would hear of the matter . He returned to his desk in the lower office and counted the sheets which remained to be copied . He took up his pen and dipped it in the ink but he continued to stare stupidly at the last words he had written : In no case shall the said Bernard Bodley be . . . . The evening was falling

" Why can't you have Alec call his boyfriend , by the way ? I'm sure Magnus knows a lot of things , too , " he asked as he waited for Raphael to pick up . Alec blushed crimson red . " He's not my - " he started to say , at the same time as Isabelle said , " We need specific vampire related knowledge . " Simon nodded slowly , taking sympathy in  EXP-Alec-EXP  who was now awkwardly shuffling his feet and adamantly staring at the floor . The line clicked , finally , and Simon was honestly surprised Raphael even bothered to answer . " Hey , " he said . " Why aren't you in my bed ? " Raphael asked in a husky voice . Simon thanked every deity in the world that he couldn't blush , because otherwise he would've been even darker red than Alec right now . " Um , " he tried , painfully aware of his friends still watching him , " Something came up .

" What , would you have wanted me to tell you about all the specific things I love about him ? Because I'm doing that later . In private . Not while we're having a moment in front of you people .

" Right , well , now that that's settled , " she said . " We did actually need you for something . " Raphael rolled his eyes . Simon found it endearing . Simon realized how very , truly fucked he was . But he didn't mind all that much , really . Later , Simon found out that the

The oblique staring expression in them fascinated him . She glanced at him once or twice and , when the party was leaving the room , she brushed against his chair and said “ O , pardon ! ” in a London accent . He watched her leave the room in the hope that she would look back at him , but he was disappointed .  EXP-Farrington-EXP  cursed his want of money and cursed all the rounds he had stood , particularly all the whiskies and Apollinaris which he had stood to Weathers . If there was one thing that he hated it was a sponge . He was so angry that he lost count of the conversation of his friends . When Paddy Leonard called him he found that they were talking about feats of strength . Weathers was showing his biceps muscle to the company and boasting so much that the other two had called on Farrington to uphold the national honour . Farrington pulled

He wanted to argue . There was never enough food , and far too many of them were going hungry . As winter rapidly approached ,  EXP-Rick-EXP  knew that it was only going to get worse . As he deliberated , Daryl finally lost patience , but kept his voice low . “ Either you eat it , or I shove it down your throat . Take it or leave it . ” Choking slightly on a laugh , but not really smiling , he reached out with shaking hands and took the plate . There was only a bit of food on it , but it was amazing .

EXP-Farrington-EXP  felt strong enough to clear out the whole office singlehanded . His body ached to do something , to rush out and revel in violence . All the indignities of his life enraged him . . . . Could he ask the cashier privately for an advance ? No , the cashier was no good , no damn good : he wouldn ’ t give an advance . . . . He knew where he would meet the boys : Leonard and O ’ Halloran and Nosey Flynn . The barometer of his emotional nature was set for a spell

He watched , speechless , as she walked back to her desk and sat down . " See , sir ? You have nothing to worry about . " She picked up her pen and calmly began working on the forms in front of her .

They would look at the map , and see what roads were best to take into town , trying to avoid anything too large . Maybe , in addition to food and gas , they could also find a police station , or even a gun shop , to get some extra ammunition . It was only a matter of time before  EXP-The Greene-EXP  ran out . For now , though , Rick found he was even more tired than he thought .

Thor was simply Thor , and made no secret of his approval , supportive of any and all love in the universe . “ Never too early to class this place up , ”  EXP-Bucky-EXP  said , grinning as he took a contented sip of his coffee .

I have never been defeated , not once . That is how I came to become Khal . ” This was one of the first times she heard him talk , and it surprised her a little .
